# Review of CitiBike project

### The formulation of null and alternative hypothesis looks fine. Comparison between two months is done which can be extended upto March to know further trend.

Two months ridership is looked into for testing whether people actually follow their new year resolutions. It would have been better if we knew before-hand whether a particular person has bike-riding as a new year resolution or not. In that
case we might be assured if the lower ridership in the next month is due to people not following their new year resolutions and not because of any other reasons.
## Test to use for hypothesis testing

Since there are two samples (months) for which the data we are comparing, the z-test should be appropriate for testing the hypothesis.
