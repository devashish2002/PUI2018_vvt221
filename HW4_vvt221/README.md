* Referenced the example notebook and plotted the graphs for the various distributions such as normal,binomial,poisson,logarithmic and chi-squared.

* Plotted the sample mean against the sample size

* Fitted a gaussian to the distribution of means

* Plotted the distribution of all sample means as a histogram

* Worked with Kloe, Rachael and Qinyu to figure out the underlying parameters for each distribution.


## Assignment 2

* Collected citibike data using the function provided in the example notebook

* Displayed the redacted dataframe

* Generated and formuated the hypothesis, descriptively and mathematically.

* Plotted the relevant graphs required to prove/disprove the hypothesis


## Assignment 3

* Retrieved the raw .txt file from github

* Stored the values in the numpy array

* Formulated the null hypothesis and set the significance level at 5%

* Calculated the zscore and evaluated the hypothesis

* Completed the assignment independently.
